                Factors Affecting Your Mental Health
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Several factors influence mental health, shaping how we feel, think, and cope with daily life. Biological factors, such as genetics, brain chemistry, and hormonal balance, play a key role in mental well-being. Environmental factors, including stress, trauma, or a lack of social support, can also impact mental health. Additionally, lifestyle choices, such as diet, sleep, exercise, and screen time, significantly affect mood and cognitive function.

                Why Mental Health Awareness Matters
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Understanding mental health is essential because it affects every aspect of our lives, from how we think and feel to how we handle stress, build relationships, and make decisions. Good mental health allows us to cope with challenges, stay resilient, and lead a balanced life. Without awareness, struggles like anxiety and stress can go unnoticed, leading to more serious issues over time.

                Maintaining optimal physical health requires a balanced approach that includes regular exercise, proper nutrition, and recovery. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, combined with strength training twice a week. Prioritize a diet rich in whole foods, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Hydration is keyâ€”drink enough water throughout the day to support metabolic function and prevent fatigue.
